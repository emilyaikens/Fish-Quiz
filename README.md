## Description:

Fish Quiz is a React app designed to test fish knowledge. This app was designed for Harvard CS50's Final Project.

This project was inspired by the Marine Conservation Society's quiz: ["How much do you know about fish?"](https://8rjae5r2z61.typeform.com/to/wGIgZsJ2?typeform-source=www.linkedin.com). I stumbled across this quiz and, as a self-proclaimed fish nerd, I could not resist the chance to show off my skills. I scored 13/15, disappointing for certain, but I the only two I got wrong were about UK-specific conservation issues so I didn't get let myself get too down about the less-than-perfect score. My biggest takeaway from the quiz was how much I enjoyed the overall experience. Appealing topic aside, I found that the UI/UX was fantastic, the artwork was beautiful (there's digital fish drawings accompanying most of the questions), and the functionality was fantastic. I decided that I would like to recreate it, but with questions that were more catered towards the marine environment that I'm most familiar with: the Northeast Pacific. It would also give me an opportunity to do some of my own digital fish drawings and try on that illustration style.Â 

When faced with the prospect of designing a final project for my Harvard CS50 course, I decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to try out my version of this fish quiz.

Why React? React is a SPA (single page application) that updates its UI in place, rather than essentially replacing the entire web page every time the user interacts with it. In other words, it is a JavaScript library that allows for dynamic UIs. I chose to use this library because I wanted the ability to transition between components (one question at a time) without reloading the page. React's State Hooks would allow user input to persist without having to store the answers to a database.

All content, including written content and digital art, was created by me. My background pre-computer science is in marine biology and graphic design.
